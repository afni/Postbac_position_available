<b>We are looking for a motivated person with an interest in science, data analysis and brain imaging.</b>

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is the largest funder of research on mental disorders in the world, with a current budget of over $1.4B. Our mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. The NIH is a highly rated employer at glassdoor.com with very competitive salary and benefits packages.

The SSCC develops and maintains [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov), one of the most widely used brain imaging packages in MRI analysis across the world.  We collaborate directly with groups at NIH and around the globe on neuroimaging projects, and also teach several week-long training courses in brain imaging methods (colloquially referred to as "Bootcamps") around the globe.  


#### What you will be doing

At present, our primary project (really, project*s*) of interest for this position would involve investigating how results both task-based and resting state FMRI studies change as various analysis steps are altered (such as type of registration to standard space, blurring, motion regression, etc.).  This would involve analyzing data sets and working with the group to determine quantitative assessments of results as well as useful means for visualization.

As part of this project, the trainee will learn first-hand about state-of-the-art brain imaging methods and processing steps, as well as develop experience in designing research questions.  The trainee will also be expected to contribute to the study design and implementation.  Likely skills obtained include: brain imaging experience, scientific methodology, image/signal processing, and scripting/programming.

 
#### Desired background

The ideal applicant would have one or more of the following properties:

+ Comfort using Linux-like terminals and scripting (e.g., tcsh).
+ Some programming background, such as Python, R and/or C/C++. 
+ An interest in "problem solving" both independently and collaboratively.

We are looking for someone to start as soon as practicable, but the timing is flexible.

The Postbac positions are for 1-2 years, with 2 being preferred.

#### Who we are
Our Core is mainly comprised of people with backgrounds in the fields of math, physics, engineering, statistics, computer science, and neuroscience.  
We develop open source, publicly available tools for the neuroimaging community, and we routinely run hands-on training workshops in MRI analysis methods (mainly FMRI and DTI).  
In all cases, work is done in collaboration with NIH researchers to ensure that the resulting methods and software are both useful and usable.  

We are located at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, USA, in the ever-interesting Washington, DC, metropolitan area.


#### Interested?
<b>Please send:</b> any queries and/or a cover letter of interest (including descriptions of your programming experience, projects worked on, etc.) and a copy of your CV to:  paul.taylor@nih.gov.
